# Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence

These sub-projects involve the application of image processing techniques, including Template Matching, Background Subtraction, Optical Flow, Mean-shift,
and Kalman Filter tracking, using offline video and webcam with Python programming. 
Additionally, the course covers machine learning concepts, incorporating Neural Networks, and delves into deep learning techniques such as CNN and RNN. 
The culmination of the course will be a final project, where machine learning is applied to image processing.
